## Plugin
### Description
This plugin is used in the case of [Virtual-Imaging-Platform](https://www.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/vip/) project.  
It is called from the *engine motor* and then utilised in completition of [GASW](https://github.com/virtual-imaging-platform/GASW).  

### Prerequisite
To run this plugin you need to use at least **Java 21** runtime environnement.  
You should also provide **config.json** file which contains the information about the plugin it self (the location shall be *./conf/conf_batch.conf*).  

### Working
To deal with PBS and Slurm we use an SSH connection which replace the API of the Kubernetes plugin for example.  

## Code
### Structure

### Updates
If you want to update the code you might easily do what you want.  
Also if a command output changes and the plugin does not work anymore you can just have a look inside *internals/command/items/mybrokenjava.java* and adapt the result function.  
There is some little parsing tools inherit from the **RemoteStream** class.
